# Description
This repo holds generic code to seed projects. Having generic code like this does a few things for me (some more applicable than others):
* Copying it over saves me some time
* I have a point to invoke a debugger
* I have top-level control of certain behaviors (e.g. exception handling)
* I have the rudiments of an interface for what ever I'm going to write
* It helps me focus on what I want to write, not the fixtures

# Rules
Personal rules for committing to this repo
* No application specific details (except as examples) should be committed with this code.
* Requirements must be tracked
* Blank run scripts should run w/o error

# Forethought
Growing this repo
* I should add to this and make it multi-lingual
* How do I reuse what I commit here (other than copy 'n paste)?
* Not sure if I should add Fantasy Grounds "blanks" here too
